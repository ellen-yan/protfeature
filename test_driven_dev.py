# TDD, paradigm of developing software. Idea: programmer thinks about
# a design specification for a bit of code, lays out what input and
# output should be, then writes a test for that code and updates code
# to pass the test. Do this incrementally.

# Use cases that we have not thought of might creep up. For everything
# that happens or a bug that's found, write another test that covers it.
# Importantly, any time you update your code, you need to run ALL of
# your tests

# pytest useful for feedback on tests; unittest from standard library
# and nose are two other major testing packages for Python
# Pytest can be run from the terminal and automatically looks for files
# starting with test_ or tests_ and ending with .py in the whole directory
# tree. Good idea to separate test
